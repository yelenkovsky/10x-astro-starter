1.  The application will be a Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Astro, using React for dynamic components.
2.  The UI will be built using Shadcn/ui components with the default theme.
3.  The application will feature two primary layouts: `AppLayout` for authenticated users and `AuthLayout` for public-facing pages like login and registration.
4.  Astro's file-based routing will manage top-level page navigation, while client-side logic will handle view switching within the main user dashboard.
5.  State management will be divided: React's Context API will handle global UI state (like user sessions), and TanStack Query will manage all server-side data and asynchronous operations.
6.  An API service layer with custom hooks (e.g., `useGetFlashcards`) will be created to abstract away direct API calls from the components.
7.  A dual strategy for error handling will be implemented: toast notifications for general API errors and inline messages for form validation failures.
8.  Application security will be enforced through protected routes, with a mechanism to automatically redirect users to the login page upon receiving a `401 Unauthorized` status.
9.  To maintain simplicity in the MVP, advanced client-side caching will be deferred, relying instead on the default caching behavior of TanStack Query.
10. A client-side router (e.g., React Router) will be used to handle navigation within the authenticated dashboard area for a scalable and robust user experience.

<matched_recommendations>
1.  **Adopt a Hybrid Framework (Astro + React):** This recommendation was matched to leverage Astro's performance for static content and React's ecosystem for building a dynamic, interactive user dashboard.
2.  **Utilize a Component Library (Shadcn/ui):** This was matched to accelerate development and ensure a consistent, modern UI across the application without extensive custom styling.
3.  **Separate Application Layouts:** The recommendation to use distinct layouts for authenticated (`AppLayout`) and public (`AuthLayout`) sections was matched to improve code organization and security.
4.  **Employ TanStack Query for Server State:** This recommendation was matched to effectively manage data fetching, caching, and mutations, which simplifies component logic and improves user experience by handling loading and error states.
5.  **Create an API Abstraction Layer:** This was matched to decouple UI components from the data-fetching logic, making the application more maintainable and easier to test.
6.  **Implement a Clear Error Handling Strategy:** The recommendation for a user-friendly error handling system was matched with the decision to use toasts for system-level feedback and inline validation for user-input errors.
7.  **Secure the App with Protected Routes:** This standard security recommendation was matched by planning for route guards that redirect unauthorized users, protecting sensitive user data and application features.

<ui_architecture_planning_summary>
The UI architecture for the 10x-cards MVP is designed as a Single-Page Application (SPA) experience within the Astro framework. React will be used for all dynamic and interactive UI components, primarily centered around a main dashboard for authenticated users.

**a. Main Requirements for the UI Architecture**
The core requirements are to build a responsive, single-page application that provides a seamless user journey for flashcard generation and learning. The architecture must clearly distinguish between authenticated and public areas, ensuring that protected content is only accessible to logged-in users.

**b. Key Views, Screens, and User Flows**
-   **Views & Screens**:
    -   `Dashboard View`: The central hub for authenticated users, featuring a tabbed interface or distinct sections for "AI Flashcard Generation," "My Flashcards," and "Learning Session."
    -   `Authentication Views`: Minimalist forms for `/login` and `/register`.
-   **Key Components**: The UI will be composed of reusable components from Shadcn/ui, including a persistent `Navigation` header, a `Flashcard` component, a responsive `FlashcardList` (DataTable on desktop, list on mobile), a `GenerationForm`, and a `SuggestionsList` for AI-generated content.
-   **User Flows**:
    -   **Authentication**: Users register or log in and are redirected to the dashboard. Unauthenticated access is restricted.
    -   **Flashcard Creation**: Users input text into the `GenerationForm`, review AI-generated flashcard suggestions, and can accept, reject, or edit them before saving.
    -   **Learning**: Users start a learning session where flashcards are presented one by one for review.

**c. API Integration and State Management Strategy**
-   **State Management**: The plan specifies a clear separation of concerns. React's Context API will manage global client-side state like the current user's session. TanStack Query (React Query) is designated for managing all server-side state, handling data fetching, caching, and mutations.
-   **API Integration**: An abstraction layer consisting of custom hooks (e.g., `useGetFlashcards`, `useCreateFlashcard`) will encapsulate TanStack Query logic. This decouples components from the API, simplifying their implementation and improving testability.

**d. Issues Related to Responsiveness, Accessibility, and Security**
-   **Responsiveness**: The plan explicitly addresses responsiveness for the `FlashcardList` component, which will adapt its layout between desktop and mobile viewports.
-   **Security**: The architecture includes plans for protected routes to secure the dashboard and an automatic redirect to the login page if an API call returns a `401 Unauthorized` error, indicating an expired session.
