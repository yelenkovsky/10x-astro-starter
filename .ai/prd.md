# Product Requirements Document (PRD) â€“ 10x-cards

## 1. Product Overview
The 10x-cards project aims to enable users to quickly create and manage educational flashcard sets. The application uses LLM models (via API) to generate flashcard suggestions based on provided text.

## 2. User Problem
Manually creating high-quality flashcards requires significant time and effort, which discourages the use of effective learning methods such as spaced repetition. The goal of the solution is to reduce the time needed to create appropriate questions and answers and simplify the process of managing learning materials.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. Automatic flashcard generation:
   - User pastes any text (e.g., textbook fragment).
   - Application sends text to LLM model via API.
   - LLM model suggests a set of flashcards (questions and answers).
   - Flashcards are presented to the user as a list with options to accept, edit, or reject.

2. Manual creation and management of flashcards:
   - Form for manually creating flashcards (front and back of card).
   - Options to edit and delete existing flashcards.
   - Manual creation and display within the "My Flashcards" list view.

3. Basic user authentication and account system:
   - Registration and login.
   - Ability to delete account and associated flashcards upon request.

4. Integration with repetition algorithm:
   - Providing mechanism for assigning flashcards to repetition schedule (using ready-made algorithm).
   - No additional metadata and advanced notification features in MVP.

5. Storage and scalability:
   - Flashcard and user data stored in a way that ensures scalability and security.

6. Flashcard generation statistics:
   - Collecting information about how many flashcards were generated by AI and how many were ultimately accepted.

7. Legal requirements and limitations:
   - User personal data and flashcards stored in compliance with GDPR.
   - Right to view and delete data (account along with flashcards) upon user request.

## 4. Product Boundaries
1. Outside MVP scope:
   - Advanced, custom repetition algorithm (we use ready-made solution, open-source library).
   - Gamification mechanisms.
   - Mobile applications (currently web version only).
   - Import of multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
   - Publicly available API.
   - Sharing flashcards between users.
   - Advanced flashcard notification system.
   - Advanced flashcard search by keywords.

ID: US-003
Title: AI Flashcard Generation
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to paste a piece of text and use a button to generate flashcard suggestions to save time on manually creating questions and answers.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Flashcard generation view contains a text field where user can paste their text.
- Text field expects 1000 to 10,000 characters.
- After clicking the generate button, application communicates with LLM model API and displays a list of generated flashcard suggestions for user acceptance.
- In case of API issues or lack of model response, user sees appropriate error message.

ID: US-004
Title: Review and Approve Flashcard Suggestions
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to be able to review generated flashcards and decide which ones I want to add to my set to keep only useful questions and answers.
Acceptance Criteria:
- List of generated flashcards is displayed below the generation form.
- Each flashcard has a button allowing for its approval, editing, or rejection.
- After approving selected flashcards, user can click save button and add them to the database.

ID: US-005
Title: Edit Manually Created and AI-Generated Flashcards
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to edit created or generated flashcards to correct any errors or adjust questions and answers to my own needs.
Acceptance Criteria:
- There is a list of saved flashcards (both manually created and approved generated ones).
- Each flashcard can be clicked to enter edit mode.
- Changes are saved to the database after confirmation.

ID: US-006
Title: Delete Flashcards
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to delete unnecessary flashcards to maintain order in my set.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Each flashcard on the list (in "My Flashcards" view) has a delete option visible.
- After selecting deletion, user must confirm the operation before the flashcard is permanently deleted.
- Flashcards are permanently deleted from the database after confirmation.

ID: US-007
Title: Manual Flashcard Creation
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to manually create a flashcard (specifying front and back of the card) to add my own material that doesn't come from automatically generated content.
Acceptance Criteria:
- "My Flashcards" view contains a button to add a new flashcard.
- Pressing the button opens a form with "Front" and "Back" fields.
- After saving, the new flashcard appears on the list.

ID: US-008
Title: Learning Session with Repetition Algorithm
Description: As a logged-in user, I want added flashcards to be available in the "Learning Session" view based on external algorithm to be able to learn effectively (spaced repetition).
Acceptance Criteria:
- In the "Learning Session" view, the algorithm prepares a learning session for me
- At the start, the front of the flashcard is displayed, through interaction user displays its back
- User rates according to algorithm expectations how well they learned the flashcard
- Then the algorithm shows the next flashcard within the learning session

ID: US-009
Title: Secure Access and Authorization
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to be sure that my flashcards are not accessible to other users to maintain privacy and data security.
Acceptance Criteria:
- Only logged-in user can view, edit, and delete their flashcards.
- There is no access to other users' flashcards or sharing capabilities.

## 6. Success Metrics
1. Flashcard generation efficiency:
   - 75% of AI-generated flashcards are accepted by the user.
   - Users create at least 75% of flashcards using AI (relative to all newly added flashcards).
3. Engagement:
   - Monitoring the number of generated flashcards and comparison with the number approved for quality and usefulness analysis.
